# Vite Example

This is an example Electron.js application that has IPC type safety using `typed-electron-ipc`. Vite is used as the bundler to create the main, preload, and renderer modules. This sample application was created using the `Electron + Vite + Vue` template available [here](https://github.com/electron-vite/electron-vite-vue).
